== SPLINEPDP FIXP Session Layer

SplinePDP uses the https://www.fixtrading.org/standards/fixp-online/[FIX Performance Session Layer (FIXP)]
as the session layer, and is designed to be similar to NASDAQ OMX, i.e. SoupTCP, SoupBinTCP, UFO (UDP for Orders).

SplinePDP is using FIXP Common Features, and will use those same naming conventions.


=== SplinePDP FIXP Implementation Details

Implementation Details outline will follow the order of each item as discussed in
https://www.fixtrading.org/standards/fixp-online/[FIX Performance Session Layer (FIXP)]


==== Framing

As SplinePDP is using FIX SOFH to define message boundaries, the SplinePDP
will use <<fix_sofh>> to also frame Session Layer Messages.


==== Message Type Identification

[quote,fixp-online]
''
Message types are listed in this document as an enumeration of symbolic names. Each FIX encoding tells how message type identifiers are encoded on the wire.
''

===== SplinePDP FIXP Enumerations

These are the values that are being used to identify messages in SplinePDP.

In addition, adding the Application Layer Messages, because while they are
defined in the specification, this is more direct.

[source, python]
----
SPLINE_MUNI_DATA_SCHEMA_ID = 42
SPLINE_FIXP_SESSION_SCHEMA_ID = 0
SPLINE_MUNI_DATA_SCHEMA_VERSION = 0


class FixpMessageType(Enum):
    Negotiate = 1
    NegotiationResponse = 2
    NegotiationReject = 3
    Establish = 4
    EstablishmentAck = 5
    EstablishmentReject = 6
    Terminate = 7
    Sequence = 8
    UnsequencedHeartbeat = 9

class SplineMuniFixType(Enum):
    Curve = 1
    Prediction = 2

class FlowTypeEnum(Enum):
    NONE = 0
    IDEMPOTENT = 1
    UNSEQUENCED = 2
    RECOVERABLE = 3
----

===== How to Use Definitions to Identify Messages

Same as in the Application Layer Messages, a SplinePDP Session
Layer Message will begin with a <<fix_sofh, SOFH>> section,
followed by a header <<include::fixsbe.adoc[tag=sbe_message_encoding_header], SBE Message Header>>,
and then followed by a Session Layer Message.

An abbreviated view of the <<sbe_message_encoding_header_label>>,

[source, rust]
----
struct SplineMessageHeader {
	blockLength: uint16,
	templateId:  uint8,
	schemaId:    uint8,
	version:     uint8,
	numGroups:   uint8,
}
// sizeof(SplineMessageHeader) = 6
----

CAUTION: For the data domain, the recommended message header of 12 octets
was deemed unnecessary. To closer fit the data domain, and reduce unnecessary
byte bloat, templateId, schemaId, version, and numGroups have been reduced
from uint16 to uint8. Additonally, numVarDataFields is not included: this
will be worked around by creating a group of bytes in a message. This both
addresses Splines requirements, and allows for a reduction in size of 2 bytes
from every message. 

==== Protocols Layering

SplinePDP will be using https://www.fixtrading.org/standards/fixs/[FIX over TLS (FIXS)]
for encryption purposes only (no authentication via the TLS layer). Server side certificate
is issued by Spline Data; there will not be client certificates issued.


https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc793[TCP/IP] and related standards will be used 
as the Transport Layer for point-to-point communication between counterparties.


Encoding will be https://www.fixtrading.org/standards/sbe-online/[FIX Simple Binary Encoding (FIX SBE) v2.0RC2],
as for Application Layer Encoding.

==== Session Identification

[quote,fixp-online]
''
Each session must be identified by a unique Session ID encoded as a UUID version 4 (RFC 4122) assigned by the client. The benefit of using an UUID is that it is effortless to allocate in a distributed system. It is also simple and efficient to hash and therefore easy to look up at the endpoints. The downside is a larger size overhead. The identifier however does not appear in the stream except once at the start of each datagram, when using UDP, or when sessions are multiplexed, regardless of the underlying transport that is used. For a non-multiplexed TCP session, the identifier therefore appears only once during the lifetime of the TCP session. A session identifier must be unique, not only amongst currently active sessions, but for all time. Reusing a session ID is a protocol violation.
''

SplinePDP is using UUIDs to identify sessions; as the SplinePDP is more akin
to a market data feed, and less an order entry feed, Spline recommends a new
UUID be used on each connection. On connect and after a session is Established,
a snapshot of recent data will be sent to counterparty followed by realtime
changes as they occur.

==== User Identification

[quote,fixp-online]
''
FIXP does not dictate the format of user credentials. They are agreed between counterparties and should be documented in rules of engagement. The Credentials field in FIXP is of datatype Object (opaque data) so no restriction on its contents is imposed by the protocol.
''

SplinePDP uses https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519[JSON Web Tokens(JWT)] to authenticate and authorize connections.
Using credentials obtained through https://splinedata.com[SplineData] and verified at
https://splinedata.com/api/login[Spline API Login], a JWT will be returned to
the caller which contains both identity and capabilities granted.


Authentication with this token will be done by using this token in the
Negotiation Message opaque field.

==== Session Lifetime

The logical session will survive only the duration of the tcp connection.
Reconnections are treated as a new established session and snapshot data
is sent after the session is in an Established state.

==== Flow Types

[quote,fixp-online]
--
Each stream of application messages in one direction on a FIXP session is called a flow. FIXP supports configurable delivery guarantees for each flow. A bidirectional session may have asymmetrical flows.

From highest to lowest delivery guarantee, the flow types are:

* Recoverable: Guarantees exactly-once message delivery. If gaps are detected, then missed messages may be recovered by retransmission.
* Idempotent: Guarantees at-most-once delivery. If gaps are detected, the sender is notified, but recovery is under control of the application, if it is done at all.
* Unsequenced: Makes no delivery guarantees (best-effort). This choice is appropriate if guarantees are unnecessary or if recovery is provided at the application layer or through a different communication channel.
* None: No application messages should be sent in one direction of a session. If ClientFlow is None, then application messages flow only from server to client.
--

SplinePDP to Client is an Idempotent Flow Type. While data is sent over TCP/IP,
which ensures order of arrival and reliability of the connection, Application Messages
do have sequence numbers in this direction that are expected to increase with
every Application Message sent. Sequence messages will be sent to counterparty during idle
times to update liveliness state.

Client to SplinePDP is a None Flow Type. The only expected communication in
this direction are Session Layer Messages. As such, the sequence number will
not increase in this direction. UnsequencedHeartbeat messages will be used to
update liveliness state with the counterparty.

==== Multiplexed session considerations

SplinePDP does not support multiplexed sessions, and therefore will not need, or
honor any Context switch messaging.

==== Point-to-Point Session Protocol

A point-to-point session between the client and server will be established over
TCP, and supports one client per connection.

==== Session Initiation and Negotiation

FIXP guidelines and messages are followed, with the exception for unsupported FIXP features.

Briefly, session initiation and establishment of the session will be as indicated
in FIXP. Multiplexing is unsupported, and requests for a multiplexed session will
result in connection termination. Being an Idempotent data connection, disconnection
of the tcp session, exchanging Terminate Messages, and FinishedSending messages are
all handled similarly. This obviates the need for FinishedSending messages, which are
currently unsupported.

Retransmission is not supported. Should it be necessary to obtain a missed message,
Spline recommends disconnecting and reconnecting. This will cause a fresh snapshot
to be sent and further messages may be applied to this.

Historic data is not supported on this feed. SplinePDP will deliver only the most
recent messages generated, and will keep at least one intervals worth of data
available in a cache to be used for snapshots.

===== Session Authentication and Authorization

As discussed, SplinePDP uses JWT tokens for the purpose of authentication and authorization
of data. Tokens issued from http://splinedata.com/api/login[Spline API Login] are valid
for approximately 24 hours. Tokens may be refreshed at any time by logging into
the Login service.

As in fixp-online, a Negotiate message is structured as follows. Examples
will be done from the point of view of client to server, therefore
in these examples the client will be offering a None Flow Type and
requesting an Idempotent Flow Type from the server.

.Negotiate Message
[%header, %autowidth]
|===
|Field name |Type |Required |Value |Description

|MessageType |Enum a|[.red]`Y` | Negotiate |
|SessionId |UUID a|[.red]`Y` | | Session Identifier
|Timestamp |nanotime |[.red]`Y` | |Time of request
|ClientFlow |FlowType Enum |[.red]`Y` |FlowTypeEnum.NONE |Type of flow from client to server
|Credentials |Object |[.red]`Y` | |
|===

===== Variable Length Data for JWT

SplinePDP message header does not have a variable length field, to work with this we will add 1 group, and the
group will define `blockLength=1` representing the size of 1 byte, and `numInGroup=len(byte_array)`, any
padding necessary to align on a 4 byte boundary may be added to the end and included in the numInGroup total.
